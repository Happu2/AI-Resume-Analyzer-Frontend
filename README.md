## üèÜ Challenge Submission

This project is a submission for the **Orbit AI - Product Enhancement Challenge (October 2025)**.

## üìã Product Choice & Rationale

**Product Chosen:** 4. Resume Editor

**Rationale:**  
The original "Resume Editor" concept helps students craft a powerful resume. However, the value of a good resume is in its ability to get a job. I saw an opportunity to "elevate" this product by closing the loop between resume feedback and resume action.

My enhancement answers the user's next logical question: *"My resume is good, but is it good for this job?"* This makes the tool an active part of the job-seeking process rather than just a passive editor.

## üöÄ My Enhancements: From Editor to Career Co-Pilot

I enhanced the "Resume Editor" by adding a powerful job-matching and analysis engine. This transforms the tool from a simple editor into an **"AI Career Co-Pilot."**

### Key Features:

1. **AI-Powered Job Matching**  
   The application analyzes the user's uploaded PDF resume against a database of real job postings.

2. **Dynamic "Fit Score"**  
   Each job match is given a percentage score (e.g., "85% Fit"). This score is not based on simple keyword matching; it is generated by the Google Gemini API, which performs a deep semantic analysis of the resume against the job description.

3. **Actionable Recommendations**  
   This is the core enhancement. For each job match, the AI provides a list of specific, actionable recommendations (e.g., "Add the keyword 'Spring Boot' to your BEL internship description," or "Highlight your 'React Query' skill more prominently").

4. **Full-Stack & Deployed**  
   The entire application is built as a production-ready, full-stack solution, deployed on Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend + Database).

5. **Modern UI/UX**  
   Includes a responsive, mobile-first design with a light/dark mode toggle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **AI:** Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash)
- **PDF Parsing:** `pdf.js-dist` (server-side)
- **Deployments:**
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Render (Web Service)
  - Database: Render (PostgreSQL)

## üîß Technical Challenges & Trade-offs

A significant technical challenge was the server-side parsing of PDF files in a modern Node.js (ESM) environment.

- Initial attempts with `pdf-parse` and `langchain` led to deep dependency and module import conflicts (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`).
- **Decision:** After failing to resolve these import issues against the deadline, I made a trade-off to find a stable, modern library. I selected and successfully implemented `pdf.js-dist` (the library used by Mozilla) in a Node.js environment. This provided reliable text extraction and resolved all import errors, allowing for a production-ready submission.

## üíª Local Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (local instance)
- Google Gemini API Key
- RapidAPI Key (for job data fetching)

### Backend Setup (`/backend` folder)

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
   npm install
```

2. **Create environment file:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` root directory.

3. **Add environment variables:**
```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_LOCAL_USER:YOUR_PASS@localhost:5432/your_db_name"
   GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

4. **Set up database:**
   - Connect to your local PostgreSQL instance
   - Run the `database.sql` file to create the necessary tables

5. **Seed job data:**
```bash
   node fetchJobs.js  # Add your RapidAPI key to the script first
   node seedDb.js
```

6. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
   npm start
```

### Frontend Setup (`/frontend` folder)

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
   npm install
```

2. **Create environment file:**  
   Create a `.env.local` file in the `/frontend` root directory.

3. **Add environment variables:**
```env
   VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api"
```

4. **Start the development server:**
```bash
   npm run dev
```
